Q. What is GitHub Actions?
A. Workflow automation service. CI/CD processes. Method for automating app dev and deployment.

CI: Code changes automatically built, tested and merged with existing code.

CD: After integration, new app or package versions are published automatically.

GH Actions makes CI/CD easier. Also helps with code reviews, issue management.

Git: Tool to manage source code changes. Save snapshots (commits), work on alternative code (branches), move between branches (checkout). Roll back if problem and not break existing code.
