# Learning MLOps

My notes and materials while learning cloud stuff in the context of machine learning (MLOps).

## Todos

* https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tutorials-and-examples/tutorial.html (Project to do: Train dog cat classifier with this way)
* Brainstorm project idea

## Goals

Do a big project that uses REST API, frontend app, Docker, GCP, Vertex AI, Terraform, Github Actions, and deep learning of course! Maybe not kubernetes hahah.

## Projects

1. Docker course, Project: [Build and Deploy Custom Docker Images for Object Recognition](https://pub.towardsai.net/build-and-deploy-custom-docker-images-for-object-recognition-d0d127b2603b)
2. GCP + Vertex AI course, Project: [Deploy image classification REST API and frontend app in GCP](https://github.com/hasibzunair/learn-mlops/tree/main/projects/image-classification).
