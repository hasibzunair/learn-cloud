# Learning MLOps

My notes and materials while learning cloud stuff in the context of machine learning (MLOps).

### GCP course todos

* Deploy API on cloud run ([link](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-python-service)), call API locally (use old docker API code for this)
* Deploy frontend gradio ML app on GCP
* Cloud run, cloud functions, Make VMs
* Do section 14 but for a vision task
* Train, test and deploy model as an API using all GCP AI components
* Auto train and deploy?
* Dockerize the API and then deploy it on a k8s cluster running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Google Cloud Run. [link](https://github.com/sayakpaul/ml-deployment-k8s-fastapi).
