## Course notes

**[April 10, 2023]** Lesson 1.

W&B Tables: Visualize data + model preds, quickly spot check rows from dataset

W&B Artifacts: Version datasets as well as models, save every step of pipeline, model tracking.

W&B Experiments: Record for model training, visualize and compare experiment, find re-run previous model checkpoints, moniotor compute, debug performance in real time.

Create reports and summarize findings.
